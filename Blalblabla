These files show the confidence tests run on the OCR'd file for the Emmerich Sister Book (E). 

First Test: 
ocr_middle_dutch_lexical_confidence.py
First Result:
page1_lexical_report.csv

Second Test:
ocr_middle_dutch_false_confidence_list.py
Second Result:
page1_false_confidence_list.csv

The Second Test adjusted the First in order to
* eliminate from the CSV any tokens that are legitimate combinations of roman numerals
* output a CSV file listing only the tokens with no match in the reference corpus in order from lowest to highest frequency in the target corpus
