The Sister Books from Master Geert's House (G) and from Diepenveen (D), as well as one published _vite_ from the Lamme van Dies House Book (L) are all available for download as XML files from the Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren (DBNL), the digital library for Dutch literature. 

These XML files then needed to be transformed into plain text files, with only the text of the body saved without any of the markup.
